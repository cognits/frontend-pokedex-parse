# frontend-pokedex-parse

We will use [Parse API](https://parse.com/docs/js_guide) to enable users to sign up and log in to their sites.
The applications ID and Key that you must use are located in [parse.txt](parse.txt).


## Prepare project
To get up and running, you must:

1. Fork the project
2. clone it locally
3. install npm modules
```{shell}
sudo npm install
```
4. install bower components
```{shell}
sudo bower install
```
5. When you clone this repository and you already install bower type
```{shell}

```

These commands will install all the necessary libraries and frameworks including: AngularJS, Jasmine and
Parse in a folder called **bower_components**.
